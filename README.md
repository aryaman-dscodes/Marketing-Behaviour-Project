# 📊 Marketing-Behaviour-Project
#### This project focuses on analyzing marketing behavior data to uncover customer insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering techniques. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and attributes, enabling businesses to target their audiences more effectively.

##  **✨ _Project Highlights_**

### **1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  
   - Handled missing values.

   - Scaled numerical features to ensure balanced clustering.

### **2. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Visualized feature distributions.

   - Identified correlations and patterns using heatmaps and pairplots.

### **3. 👥 Customer Segmentation:**

   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

   - Grouped customers into segments using K-Means clustering.

### **4. 📝 Results:**

   - Segmentation results saved in Clustered_Marketing_Data.csv.

   - Visualized clusters for better interpretation.

### **5. 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:**

   - **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.

   - **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization.

   - **Scikit-learn:** Clustering and feature scaling.
